offends people or if i am not very nice i am stating my opinions and don t like to sugar coat things so it might be a bit jarring when compared to typical <UNK> you see around here the last time i talked to the <UNK> dev team they were still trying to figure out what they wanted to do and jackson said that he would wait for more <UNK> before considering merged mining well it s been <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> has behaved pretty much as i expected when i did my the <UNK> <UNK> was about of <UNK> s <UNK> today the <UNK> is of <UNK> s pretty much all the asic <UNK> went to <UNK> which i warned would happen the <UNK> s network security is in danger of being attacked the can easily pull off a attack on the <UNK> network in a few weeks the top <UNK> pools can easily do it a scrypt asic farm can decide that it wants to have some fun the <UNK> network <UNK> is about <UNK> s so as an example a <UNK> s farm can easily it here s the earning ability of <UNK> s it makes about per day let s say it takes about minutes to pull off this attack that s <UNK> confirmations the attacker loses about if he stops mining <UNK> for an hour they could try to attack one of the and try to steal bitcoins to make it worth their time or they can double spend a which is worth about or maybe they just don t like <UNK> and it only costs them <UNK> s network security is worth only so what can you do honestly i m not sure merged mining is a viable option anymore as it is becoming less and less viable with each passing day merged mining was the best option in april when i first proposed it at that time if merged mining was implemented almost every single <UNK> and <UNK> pool will switch to do merged mining right away because adding merged mining of <UNK> would increase their mining output by today adding merged mining will only increase earnings by it s hard to say how many pools will switch some might think it s not worth their time so it would take a big pr push to make this work you re now left with a hard choice don t do anything and hope do merged mining and try to convince all the pools to do it switch to another algorithm and hope you can compete better against other gpu mined coins switch to proof of stake and accept all the that come with that i think the dev team needs to do something soon"}, {"title": "user makes a post about the amount of toxic players they ve played against recently people pile out of the woodwork to victim blame and show the community s true colors", "body": "<UNK> <UNK> <UNK> hiero longtime lurker rarely post around these parts i was laying in bed reading on my phone when i noticed this post i opened it up because while i haven t had this general issue myself i have run into quite a large number of toxic players in league recently which isn t unusual at all but recently the system used to punish toxic behavior the tribunal has been down for the past few months to be re tooled so i figure perhaps there is a correlation there now has never been an incredibly mature community but holy shit i couldn t believe some of the things i was seeing as you can see op who suffers from depression has allegedly been told to kill themselves times in the past two weeks and was pointing out that none of them players who did this have been punished for it so this user comes to the subreddit to ask for advice and basically tries to get riot s attention and instead people pour into the comments to downvote and tear the op apart left and right apparently people don t believe op or believe op is exaggerating greatly whether this is true or not doesn t matter because the responses that follow a lot of them due to this assumption that op is bullshitting are incredibly fucked up here s a sampling gt people in week really you should really look at yourself if you manage to provoke this much hate gt gt maybe if you cry about it the bad mans will stop hurting your feelings gt sounds like your panties are in a knot grow up and stop caring what people on the internet think of you nerd ah yes off to a lovely start but then gt why didnt you die weeks after they told you and there it is gt did u suck in that games <UNK> gt i have wins in normals wins in ranked gold elo and never did anyone tell me to kill myself or wish me cancer and all thst jazz seriously you must be so provocative and so bad at this game that your team mates turn all hyper on your noob ass mute them and report seriously some riot programmer works his ass off to add a mute button and yiu dont use it fuk u man gt you must be reallly bad at this game dude gt i like to write this to people that give up and goes afk because of some shit in the game i know its very offensive but i also hope it can open the eyes for some of the guys but depression or no depression i still think what i ve done is fair no matter how bad it may sound this guy should become a therapist what great sage advice gt i don t get you people who cry on the forums reddit about this if you re so insecure that someone saying something to you in a video game is hurting your feeling that s disgusting just mute them if you can t have any negative human interaction gt you probably need to stop feeding so hard gt depressed people shouldn t play league of legends league is a game of strong minds unistall it or play just bot games or customs with your friends gt gt so true look at all of this victim shaming gt have you ever thought that maybe you re the problem more victim shaming gt i ve said this before having played since s not once have i been told to kill my self maybe you need to stop being an asshole or acting like a retard in ranked right i forgot it s op s fault gt play better gt youre so dramatic its unbelievable you do know theres a mute option if you re that depressed just fucking mute everybody not trying to be mean just being logical gt stop crying op lmao gt nobody cares and if it really bothers you that much you need to go out more see no op posted this in hopes to get the developer s attention because they frequent the subreddit fairly often i think the fact that op can t enjoy the game they like because of the amount of toxic people they have randomly encountered is a legit complaint and is most definitely something that needs to be addressed if it s getting that bad and whether op is telling the truth or not shouldn t matter because the fact that the tribunal is gone means players who are reported aren t being overseen by actual humans who are passing judgment on whether or not they should be punished for their behavior there s more but i m not going to post it all i think it very well speaks for itself the subreddit no the community is full of immaturity and this proves it it s hard to believe the shit i was reading op is asking for help and instead gets trashed by redditors signing out for the night stay classy reddit keywords league of legends a popular free to play online moba game with millions of daily players toxic term used to express the people in the community who behave well like asshats tribunal system in which players of a certain level can go through read reports and pass judgment on the accused players based on chat and game logs and accusations players are usually banned or given chat restrictions this system is currently down and being retooled by the developer to be more effective and has been for quite a while in the mean time reports are being filtered automatically for certain behaviors a system which doesn t work nearly as well"}, {"title": "a user in is mad that u <UNK>

not even close to a locked fps it feels like it s running at something most of the time and i ve had it drop way below that a couple of times already really fucking disappointed right now as i m a huge ac fan and this game plays like absolute shit edit seems this game runs poorly across all platforms pc included another edit linking to a comment i posted in the review thread on lots of mentions of the frame rate problems from pro reviews"}, {"title": "i need a bit of loving reddit seems to hate me", "body": "<UNK> <UNK> ngp e <UNK> bit of a backstory i guess ive been on reddit for years actively i hop on every day and usually stay on for an hour or a few hours look at my link karma thats right look at my comment karma years comment karma ive noticed that in more than just a few subreddits ive been getting more downvotes than upvotes for reasons that i just dont understand where ive been downvoted heaps all i did was ask a few questions i dont think its my fault that i dont know anything about a game i just wanted to know what civ was and how i could learn more about it take a further look if i said i would get downvotes if i told someone that they were being rude to me then i would get even more downvotes and they would get upvotes its silly now you might just say but it does it honestly sorta stabs at my heart when i see all these things im saying get heaps of downvotes what am i doing wrong i never thought i could get upset over a silly forum like website like reddit i know you guys over here in cc have some kind words"}, {"title": "nuclear rage update", "body": "<UNK> <UNK> s g y <UNK> about a week ago http but you guys came through with support and validation which gave me an injection of strength i needed that as the little tests were not over and i knew that showing weakness will only make them worse your support was exactly what i needed the days after she was in her more she behaves like angry child that can t say what you she wants for example she started huffing and puffing in the kitchen i was in the other room taking care of our son i heard the huffing and puffing and knew this was one of those times the key is when she acts like a child i can t act like a parent that only encourages her more to throw tantrum i have to act like an adult saying clearly i expect her to talk like an adult this doesn t mean accusing her of being a child or not being an adult that kind of judgment is just talking to her as i was a reproaching father and only makes the tantrum worse instead i took a deep breath did my mindfulness strength tricks and went to the kitchen i said she said i look around the kitchen trying to make sense of the mess she has made i don t know what is going on i focus on deep breathing and staying cool she then accuses more i breathe deep i know this pattern all too well now she isn t going to get to me with it i just have to stay acting like an adult until she realizes the childish tantrum won t get her what she wants so i say and then finally says i have an idea of what she wants but i m not going to do guess it she has to act like an adult and she says and i say so i go to the pantry bring out the little ladder we have there and set it up in front of the cabinet she is a bit stunned it never occurred to her to just use the steps we have for this purpose so she just complains about that solution we finished the task and her anger had dissipated it was a bit strange because as i helped she was realizing how her tantrum was about nothing i didn t tell her she was acting like a child but by acting like an adult waiting for her to turn into an adult she got the message the next few days were full of stuff like this i saw my therapist and she congratulated me on staying strong managing well and told me to keep strong that i should expect a few more weeks of this childish tantrums until my wife really internalized the changes and that i wasn t going to give in my boundaries this helped me a lot to feel like i wasn t the crazy one or i was being mean by keeping my boundaries i made reservations for a restaurant and got a baby sitter for the weekend i told wife i needed a break from the stressors we had from the move and i thought this would feel good and i wanted her to come with me it might be fun she put all sorts of excuses but never actually said no to the dinner so i interpreted this as more where she just wanted to see if her emotions could sway me so i stayed on course i validated her excuses but never gave in we weren t negotiating because she never said she didn t want to go she is just bringing up excuses to see if i argue with her i said things like i never said said i would cancel depending on her frankly if she had said no i wasn t going to cancel anything i would have gone by myself if it came to it and told wife that she can rest in her room while the babysitter takes care of things this mentality helped me ignore her excuses she was just fishing for a fight and if i gave in i lost after a whole day of her complaining and bringing up excuses about why we shouldn t got she got dressed to go out to dinner and we had a wonderful dinner

had done all the right things the next few days have been really good she is so i wouldn t be surprised that in the next week there will be another smaller tantrum but that if i stay strong things

refutations of what i wrote argument for darwinian truth ontology the fundamental component of your ontology your being is survival your first priority superseding everything else is to survive the only exceptions are when people willingly die for a higher cause that almost invariably involves the survival of others or kill themselves either way it s priority number when you look at the world you don t see the material world as it is most of what you perceive is a trick of your mind you categorize everything into objects and pay attention to only the ones that you think would be useful to you the world is essentially a series of tools psychologically speaking tools that help you achieve some goal fulfill some value your mind is operated to act and see s the world in terms of how to act to think of the world scientifically you have to choose to do so you only do it for some reason like you think it would be useful for a survival perspective or you value empirical truth because you think it s more useful or you think it s fun which is a value every time you engage in science it s grounded in some value but it s actually just a story you tell yourself the big bang is empirically true but it s also a figment of your imagination when we evolved to figure out how the world was around us how did we do it well anything that got it wrong was more likely to die anything that was closer to the empirical truth had a much higher chance of staying alive and having kids our conception of truth as it evolved was grounded in survival that doesn t mean we evolved to see the empirical truth sometimes knowing something empirically true will get you killed there s no reason to assume we evolved to be good scientists to be empiric you have to pretend you re not human you re an unfeeling robotic entity out in the universe or the universe itself or you re observing yourself but not yourself none of that is real you are human whether you like it or not you exist now not millions of years from now or in the past but now you can imagine that you re something else or that it s the future but you can t escape humanity pragmatism we can never know the full truth we know our laws of physics are wrong even if we did know them it s very complicated to get exact answers to things you have to start approximating when things get even a little bit complicated even if you could do things exactly you d need an impossible supercomputer etc etc our minds will never really know empirical truth we couldn t even comprehend it how do we conceive truth then if everything we know is false well we think of things as true enough this applies to every scientific theory none of them are true they re only true enough newton s laws are true enough at one level of analysis but they break down at very small and very large levels of analysis so we use better theories etc our conception of scientific truth is already pragmatic values the way you get from pragmatic empiricism to darwinian truth is by invoking ontology you are human you will never be not human empirical truth means you have to in a sense pretend you are a cold unfeeling robot with no subjective irrational impulses no such thing exists besides sam harris of course you re stuck being human you will always be human till you die values are the fundamental makeup of your being they re how you decide how to act everything else even thinking is grounded in that notion when you are thinking something through logically it s grounded in values you can t act without values even if you re not aware of them you have to act to think it s inescapable you re fundamentally an animal what is your fundamental value survival how did we evolve to know truth survival thus truth is darwinian or pragmatic it s not really redefining anything it s saying this is what truth was the whole time jordan also makes the point that before science something that s only years old his conception of the truth was the default it s been the default for hundreds of millions of years of humanity that precedes us if you think about it that way sam is the one redefining truth furthermore empirical truth doesn t include values at all you can argue that there are moral truths like there s no empirical way to prove that that makes a lot of sense pragmatic truth encompasses those too sam s conception of it actually does but he has to redefine what he means by reality and what he means by morals it gets very messy and there s numerous problems with it if you read people s critiques of his books thus because your ontology is grounded in values truth isn t empirical empirical truth is grounded in pragmatic truth most of the time it s pragmatic to be empirical but not always in fact for sam s conception of truth to make any sense you have to take it as self evident meaning you have to take it on faith but it s not the only way of defining truth by any means jordan s conception runs into issues too but in a different way instead of having to take it on faith you re dealing with a circular argument since you re basing it on ontology before you define truth but how can you know your ontology is true if you haven t defined truth although you could take it on faith too if you wanted and avoid that but then you d have the same issue as sam this is all explained better in the article i linked objections to the argument sam s arguments on the podcast were to expose contradictions where something would kill everyone thus making it not true but it was still empirically true that seems ridiculous but it s not a contradiction since empirical truth is just a subset of pragmatic truth it s empirically true but morally false since morality is truer than empirics then it s false at the highest level of analysis this is analogous to newton s laws compared to quantum mechanics or relativity they re true enough at one level of analysis but overall false you can derive newtonian mechanics from those higher theories you can t do it the other way around analogously you can derive an is from an ought you can t derive an ought from an is morality is fundamental and pragmatic truth reflects that empirical truth is an approximation you can derive from pragmatic truth namely that it s pragmatic to be empiric sometimes it doesn t work the other way around the other common argument that came up a lot on sam s subreddit was that this conception is impractical but that just proves pragmatic truth right if you say it s more practical to use truth sams way then you re saying the notion of truth must be grounded in pragmatism it s a value things are pragmatic because they help you survive even if you just value empirical truth for its own sake you re still doing it because you think it s useful i think on the podcast they were asking two different questions vs if you ask the second question you have to have a truth nested in values because you re using values to answer the question if you re using the first one you could get sam s truth or you could get this one it pretty much has to be taken on faith it s not obvious that one definition is correct or that anything is being redefined the only thing i don t understand is how causality works i figure it s just a pragmatic thing too like in the affair example from the podcast how do you know what caused the suicide well it was probably the photos or something else it s something that s true enough which could neatly solve the contradiction harris was trying to invoke it s just very hard to pi exactly which belief caused what it could have been knowledge of the affair or maybe how the man thought of relationships or something he thought that goes back to childhood it s much too complicated to say exactly what caused what that s the gist of it i m not seeing a logical way out of it to be honest with you none of the pro sam arguments i saw on his subreddit and elsewhere were convincing they all misunderstood some portion of

really has some trolls among them or people just don t have the proper experiences to even judge either way in this forum i will make sure to answer all questions you have i also feel this community will be more supportive than on my next post i will be going into details on what i was shown when i close my eyes and i m taking to the cosmic playground its quite the coincidence that as soon as i made a facebook group and now this reddit group i ve been shown so much more they really want me to tell their story and our story what they are showing me is a dimension that i feel all humans are actually suppose to see before death this is place i see is not the end but the beginning just like everyone grows up and desires to produce a baby or not this dimension is the same way do you want to spend time to cultivate a wonderful place that will guide you through the rest of your life in this life and the next i would urge you to say yes this is perhaps the greatest dimension to be in to find answers that ancient text mention thoth is the man thoth literally has told us so much and left out just enough to force the soul to do it the hard way he gives you just enough knowledge to get yourself in trouble if you jump in too soon i heard some of the tablets went missing and i bet he tells you exactly how to do what he does and what i do its all quite straight forward which is why i m so excited to share and to start this healing temple i will make sure every human soul has the tools to explore this realm as its necessary to really grow spiritually and its there for you right now a few messaged me awhile ago and mentioned they can also see what i see which makes me realize this is a strange truth about our human existence we are multi dimensional beings and in this life time you can understand how cosmic you are i ll be explaining the cosmic web look at the banner it looks just like this except more web like and tons of very scary looking creatures they are scary looking only to the inexperienced traveler though they look terrifying although you learn early on to never judge a book by its cover you will be tested greatly on your travels with fear and darkness thoth also mentions this and he s spot on the greatest skill you ll learn is to trust the cosmos trust the spirits they all are here to help not hurt you i ll also go into details about the green cosmic egg and the headed serpent which can also take form as a massive dragon they showed me how all of these great cosmic beings create immense life everyone who explores where i explored will acquire cosmic guides that will always be with you you will be able to see them with eyes closed once you unlock the cosmic egg i will explain the process it took me and the order the entities appeared to me the first cosmic god you will unlock is the cosmic serpent the second is the cosmic egg the third is the cosmic web womb once you meet these cosmic guides they will always be there for you and at this point your life is heaven on earth they will never let you fall because you ve climbed so far i ve also been getting a lot of messages about crystal orb entities visiting them this is exactly what i was told would occur more and more entities of the light at first they will only show you they are hyper dimensional orbs they will later show you their past lives their preferred look here are more

the post in which <UNK> destroys a year old kid s hopes and dreams", "body": "<UNK> <UNK> iib <UNK> https so here s the skinny a young aspiring archaeologist combed through the codex madrid to identify maya constellations using gis he overlaid the constellations on the maya landscape and found that the known classic maya sites apparently lined up with the constellations from there he predicted that another maya site would be located in eastern belize as one of the constellations seemed to have a site when he combed through satellite imagery he found architectural mounds where he predicted the site would be on its surface this is an awesome story this young man is already diving into mesoamerican archaeology at an early age he s learned about maya astronomy maya codices and has learned the maya landscape he s using gis to interpret satellite imagery which frankly is something many college students struggle with and even if he s got help with interpreting it that s an amazing accomplishment in no way should that be under emphasized i hope this kid gets a full ride scholarship and goes on to do great research on the other hand there is absolutely no way that this is true at least not the way the news articles are reporting it lets start on the most basic level what does it mean to an archaeological site the first step in any archaeological project is survey this can involve using remotely sensed imagery like satellite multispectral imagery synthetic aperture radar or lidar more traditionally it involves getting a bunch of people to walk and or machete in straight lines along a regular grid and catalog anything they find thousands of surveys are carried out world wide every year pretty much each and every one of them finds new archaeological sites that hadn t been registered before of course local people often knew about these sites beforehand but often times these sites are not by archaeologists or registered in national databases typically most archaeological sites are fairly small a scatter of artifacts a few buildings some half buried agricultural terraces this isn t to say that previously unknown archaeological sites of a large scale aren t found on occasion but typically the really huge archaeological sites are in areas that haven t been surveyed extensively already either because they re in areas people have overlooked or in hard to reach locations in the case of this article the purported new city is in eastern central belize not far from the coast there is absolutely no way that a huge city is located there that nobody has ever seen before it may not be registered in a database that the student in question had access to or it may not be as large as he thinks it is the article itself is rather inconsistent on the size of the site it claims at one point that the site comprises visible architectural mounds and at another point claims it covers to square km the article also claims that it is the fourth largest in the maya world there s a joke among mesoamerican archaeologists what s the typical nuclear family in belize the mother the father the children and the maya archaeologist staying with them to study the nearby ruins of all the regions in mesoamerica belize is the most heavily studied this is due to the fact that belize s official language is english they re the only country in the area that allows field schools and the classic maya have the sexy alure of the trope that dominates pop archaeology the odds that a city that big in that particular area had escaped study for that long are slim to none the second claim of the article is that this somehow verifies the theory that the maya landscape is a massive <UNK> where the placement of cities reflects the stars in maya constellations lets think about that for a minute how are you overlaying constellations on the landscape how are you defining the orientation of the constellations how are you measuring distance the fact is that the maya lowlands was so densely populated that if you were to take a series of random points and scale and rotate them enough you could probably get it to line up with a pattern of archaeological sites hell you could probably throw a dart at a map of the peten and you d probably hit pretty close to an archaeological site but on a deeper level the idea that city placement corresponds to cosmology on that scale implies a top down plan that we frankly know didn t exist maya cities have different origins some were occupied going back to the formative <UNK> period others were founded later all were ruled by their own political dynasties that did not typically coordinate with each other the entire classic maya civilization was dominated by an elite culture composed of feuding lineages that were constantly seeking to one up their rivals through warfare and competitive festivals so while we have lots of evidence for cosmically informed planning within cities there are few examples of that between cities to suggest that such a cosmic order existed across the entire maya lowlands would require rejecting mountains of evidence demonstrating the opposite don t get me wrong i think it s awesome that this kid is doing satellite based remote sensing surveys at i think it s awesome that he found some ruins through that regardless of whether anybody already knew about it but lets not blow this whole thing

knows google i generally end up supporting her business it kit for fun mainly but every now and then she pays me with a cake or a roast dinner or a slab of fudge these tales are several years old now and the events that unfold in them just go to show why you should never offer tech support even on a professional level to any family member it s late i d had a year from hell and was taking a break between jobs by now i d got used to telling people and watched as they discarded my expert advice things came to a head with my ex as i had tried in vain to explain to her that her website outage was beyond the remit of me to solve and was due to the hosting provider s datacenter going bankrupt and locking its doors i was against her using that company in the first place because i had found a better service but the hour changeover would result in too much downtime apparently she could speed things up by yelling at their support something i never thought about doing i was in london on holiday when it all kicked off i sent her an email blocked her from calling me and enjoyed the rest of my week off it took her two whole weeks to get a new service running and she did all of this without me when i eventually went around to speak to her i was told that i wasn t needed any more as chris would now be her it support and developer he looked smug but i knew that something was going to go wrong along the line meanwhile i managed to contact the old host who had eventually got access to their servers but were now downsizing as they had significant losses i had a good clean copy of all her software and data because i knew that chris was slowly destroying my hard work having not much to do i m enjoying life when a former colleague calls me he and i both worked for the same it

another week until my new job started a quick cash would go a long way i get home to several emails from bob with the vpn settings and access details and begin to delve firstly the times of the attacks are all during the daytime which points to someone inside the company but doesn t exclude an external attack i make a note of the times of the last ten data issues and check the connection logs very little came through the online contact forms or online store during that time their shopping cart software is protected and the i results filtered and stripped to avoid injection attacks anyway i check the system logs and there are several users logged in on their software but out of the last ten occurrences only one person is connected all times i don t believe in co incidences so i find the machine that user office sits at thankfully wake on lan is enabled so i wake it then connect to the machine and browse the c drive there we hit the motherlode office has sql software installed as well as several sql scripts and archived databases i edit one and it contains the commands to delete the database and several others that would empty tables checking office s ad account he has almost complete access to the network and resources using bob s admin level account i cannot access some folders on the network but office can i reset the password of that account and log in mainly to check what s in those folders i m slightly relieved when i find sql training materials from a local training supplier that i have actually heard of so i think i understand what s going on office has been employed as a hybrid office person who knows a little it part of his role is tech support and the difficult tasks are escalated to bob unfortunately office appears to be inept and is constantly running test data and training commands against the live database and nerfing it i lock out the office account disconnect and write my report emailing it to bob he manages to read it at am so i m guessing that office is in for a bad day when he or she rolls in to work the next day was super busy management meeting dev progress meeting training users on new software working lunch then major push to complete new monitoring software i m in the middle of the dev meeting when i feel my mobile vibrate in my pocket two minutes later it vibrates again text i return to my office and check

python and r winning against proprietary vendors d <UNK> i think it is not necessary the case of but a general software development cycle that we have just seen come to it s end let me explain opensource mainly benefits from transparency and accessibility but more often then not are not able to get the necessary material support outright to cover expenses of professional development at the late stages it usually has wide community support money code audit and ideas are coming from outside and costs are shared organically and voluntarily proprietary products benefit from high and immediate market incentive which is able to cover the cost of development completely at early stages things that it s lacks at the late stage is justification for later payments because consumer is already satisfied at late stage opensource incorporates all the futures from proprietary code plus has sustainable distribution of fatigue of supporting it plus writing code becomes cheaper proprietary projects are substituted or become opensource but i do not like the term proprietary project inspire opensource at the middle and early stage i would say that almost any area is predominantly proprietary at the beginning and later becomes to open at the end look for example at apple that has as of late become free i would assume that the next stage is to open this product because it will be much cheaper for apple to maintain while much easier to develop at the same time and attract consumer to it s main products macbooks and if they don t do that then then they have to support different versions of mac os x in order to keep user base happy which will cost them much more then maintaining last version and giving it away for free unreal and cryengine are moving this way it s even less justified because while tool kits come farther it is cheaper to write code compare rust to c for example former offers out of the box security for compiled code and palatalization which means it is cheaper to write secure parallel code which lowers the bar significantly for open source projects and makes competition really tight for proprietary ones gt is your analysis from the point of view of the developer of open source and or proprietary software or is it from the point of view of developers using that software i base my analysis from historic tendencies of different niches categories of software not even a particular product world not developers i am in general trying to be out if personal of pov here because it makes defending it much more complicated may darwin being is a result of niche of software dedicated to operating systems core development mac os x becoming free is a result of apple being unable to justify motivate to pay it s price to it s customers both are outlining a tendency to a accessibility i would say i do not make any distinction in that but it works both ways i am not sure i made it particularly clear but i can try to make my argument more i guess structured every software niche has this factors and attributes it needs resources aka human hours to develop it has stages of development early when it s mostly uncharted to late stage when most ideas have already been implemented somewhere popularity which is from low to high nr is easier to satisfy proportionally to sd and p with growth of sd it is also harder to justify proprietary investments because customer is satisfied already which brings prices down rise in p drives up competition which again drives prices down also because sd ideas can be copied and mimicked which drives nr down at late stage from economical point of view it s better to open the code and earn money on support which happened with unix and is model of most open projects"}, {"title":

historical ignorance in drawing borders on the one hand you have cartographers who completely ignore all historical context who in merging nations decide that african borders decided upon by european powers are somehow an accurate representation of different cultures and will often create completely arbitrary boundaries based on seemingly little more than aesthetic on the other hand you have those who give historical boundaries too much relevance in a modern context and believe that all of the countries that once constituted the roman empire will suddenly merge back together overnight because well they had in the past this map manages to reach both levels of ignorance let s start by getting nitpicky several pacific islands are not colored in at all op s response to this indonesia is not a part of its own civilization southeast asia however is papua new guinea is african now hell if all tribal cultures are the same let s just lump in greenland while we re at it the philippines are latino a distinction that bypasses culture altogether and is apparently based on little more than the dominance of catholicism in the region japan mongolia korea and china all being part of the same

speaking all four nations are far more distinguishable than say romania and russia yet somehow cultures have been surgically removed from western civilization altogether despite being buddhist bhutan

population of also falls under the category of the whole category is a mess the distinction between the sunni civilization and shia civilization too seems to completely ignore all demographical and historical background and instead insists on having a neat little line dividing the entire middle east in half problem solved everybody as usual sub saharan africa is generalized into one homogenous group isn t it funny how cultural and religious divides always seem matter in europe but not in africa but wait he didn t just group all of africa into one category south africa is enlightened because

esque ideas spread quickly gt enlightened african better human rights record moving towards western or at least eurasian civilization tribal ideas still around just not as widespread overall there s

map in general gt hm interesting as a cultural anthropologist i would be reluctant to use the word especially in terms of referencing south africa your reference with the appears to suggest the label because of some contact between european societies which i guess is why you apply it to south africa it comes across as ethnocentric and valuing western culture as opposed to valuing diversity and freedom within the local culture when looked at within south africa it makes it sound as if the europeans did the right thing in bringing colonialism and bringing apartheid in the end it can appear that western civilization and western style rights are the end goal or chief point of human civilization note that i am not saying that western style rights are bad one of the difficulties in making such a map is broad sweeping generalizations which can unfortunately miss a lot of the <UNK> complexities and nuances in each country going by how they act can unfortunately give a poor picture of a nation because of colonialism globalization minority majority not sure where you are in your studies and you maybe already read these but i would look through some works on critical theory as an

developed and for what it s worth i ve never seen one of these maps that i ve agreed with we have enough problems with our current borders and to the belief that we could solve everything by arranging

only get worse next season with exponential sr gain loss at the start of the season edits woah front page amp top post also just saw this with something like k upvotes on the main overwatch subreddit anyway i mean to clarify i did not say that asia servers are grouped in with americas since some of the comments are construing it as such i said that the sea servers are grouped in with the americas the same way oce is asian hackers who choose to connect to the americas servers therefore get either placed on the sea or oce servers due to geographical proximity best ping etc some of them have korean <UNK> some don t most of the time they don t say anything in game so it s hard to tell some of the comments have been saying that on the actual na servers there are very few hackers i don t know the reason for this perhaps people on na are just better people lul perhaps a larger player population means the hacker to player ratio is a lot smaller thus a lower chance that you d run into one at say sr who knows secondly i understand the reason for <UNK> entirely but a whole season a report system that is functionally irrelevant some of these hackers are into the top players some of

every games on average i am not exaggerating many other sea master tier solo queue players can vouch for this especially so in the evenings i just have the ill luck of playing solo ranked on a small server with rampant hackers also no i don t feel i am being unfair or ungrateful to blizzard none of us expect maximum efficiency but we expect to have our concerns duly addressed koreans have been bringing this issue up in their own capacity for months and there has been no word from blizzard whatsoever i don t expect them to check every single report that comes in or even for that matter every account which has a high number of reports here s the thing hacker makes an account proceeds to stomp placements places high he gets higher and higher starts facing more and more of the same people at the upper end of the bell curve these same people report him daily whenever they bump into him if blizzard doesn t want to care about players with a high number of reports or doesn t have the

wrong about the effects of increased skilled labor first of all he is focusing on the increased supply of labor and has completely forgotten to think about the increased demand for labor due to the increased consumer demand for local services because of this natives benefit from immigration through overall increased wages and higher job growth the evidence for higher wages for natives without a high school degree is mixed but the effect of overall increased wage growth for natives is clear on top of this skilled immigration especially is beneficial for the native population scientists

music is made for parents with young children newborns it is really soft and in the case of my newborn it kept her calm i know ori and the blind forest is not for everyone but seriously if you are looking for a game to play that isn t going to wake a kid up look no further and for all you parents out there that know you are going to be hitting pause regularly it is also great being a single

you today about what kind of subreddit this is and how we mods have tried to make this a good community for a while now we ve had rules against certain types of and these rules were to maintain a certain quality in this subreddit head off complaints from people who want to see quality content and because even we mods hate certain <UNK> like posts begging for upvotes or the posts personally i hate these types of posts and i d prefer that one of made it to the top of and be representative of our subreddit however on closer reflection we have discovered a few things reddit really loves low quality <UNK> if it was possible to post nothing but a comment section with no title whatsoever people on reddit would upvote it to the moon this is the website that made a by an administrator the number one post sitewide for the longest time posts and preventing certain <UNK> from getting posted or removing <UNK> after they get posted doesn t actually prevent any of the whining and complaining we get whenever any of s posts gets onto we could have a pulitzer prize winning self post written by the ghost of j d salinger on why the dumbfuck and trump sucks so hard and it would still get whining assholes in the comments bitching about and saying people who click on the comments to whine about a subreddit reaching are the real spammers they are guests in this subreddit regardless of how they got here and reddit has no expectations on how a post reaches the top of unless you cheat the algorithm preventing the lowest effort of the low effort <UNK> prevents this subreddit from reaching the top of we mods are essentially hobbling the popularity and visibility of our subreddit to try to satisfy people who are never satisfied and to prevent whining from people who will whine anyway no matter what we do this leads us to conclude that if you browse you are agreeing to see a huge number of subreddits and take them as they are in their state if you don t like this either which will allow you to filter out subreddits you don t want to see on or get which will do the same thing you know what you don t do bitch and whine in the threads that reach about how you hate seeing that subreddit on and you think this is spamming if you come into this subreddit to claim that we or that we re then there is a chance you re a fucking trump troll and you need to immediately get banned if not if you actually turn out to be that who has no love for the trump or the dickless that means you have no fucking manners and you need to get banned for being an annoying asshole

thought or so smug that you probably try to bottle your farts to sell as the most delicate perfume we have a that you can see on our sidebar if you truly care about higher quality posts then this is for you go ahead and avoid the <UNK> if you want we mods shouldn t be preventing the subscribers of this subreddit from doing what every other subreddit on reddit does <UNK> to their heart s content we mods have no obligation to prevent our subreddit from getting more visible on just because some people are rude assholes who just have to whine in the comments whenever a subreddit they don t like

queasy ride link was the rallying cry before as parliament had levied repeated duties without any involvement of the million colonists parliament did collect on its taxes and sent tax collectors specifically for this many of whom were tarred and feathered in defiance taxes imposed on british colonial trade were also definitely collected as it was the only way to enter the lucrative market the crown did not want colonists expanding too far westward although again the colonists had had little say the expansion would exacerbate tensions with native american tribes who made local treaties with representatives of the crown though sometimes with the presence of colonists the colonists did provoke war with france but the uk had wanted a war anyway over other issues such as monarchic succession in spain and grabbing french possessions in india this is to say nothing of the fact that they had been using the dutch and iroquois as proxies to push out the french and <UNK> along the great lakes region for years this is also untrue as parliament was well aware of the colonists dissatisfaction after the stamp act the townsend acts and the tea act the question of the increasingly angry colonists was one that dogged the administrations of three separate prime ministers the olive branch petition had also been sent by a faction of americans as a last ditch effort before full independence which also went unheeded by the crown benjamin franklin made a number of statements to dozens of british patrons nobles and citizens on his trip to england that he made falsely represent the state of tension of the thirteen colonies isn t some grand deception given how aware everyone was of the rising protest movement at all and besides he is certainly allowed subterfuge given his unofficial role as ambassador for the independence movement independence did not come out of nowhere the uk s representatives in the thirteen colonies had repeatedly informed parliament of the situation and is partly why boston was put under military occupation for a year directly sparking the first two battles of the revolution the attitude that they were children was exactly why many colonists rebelled they were underdogs who fought a vastly superior military but they were also fighting to keep the relative autonomy and freedoms they had enjoyed for over a century when the homeland tried to reassert control a revolution happened so setting aside that the video seems to use a literal strawman argument to push garbage that would make even cringe it ignores literally every

this guy s friend sounds like one heck of a prankster if only you could make bomb jokes in american airports the horror moving on we get to how redditors really feel about the tsa and why they hate it so gt the tsa agents i see in jfk lga here in nyc are the ghetto kids from high school who couldn t find a better job they barely passed courses and yet they are allowed to running security for airports it s absolutely frustrating to see this ahhh the also i don t think low level tsa agents are any more than a senators intern is writing policy but thats besides the point gt the tsa is a veiled jobs program literally welfare gt i beginning to think that the job requirements for being a tsa agent is equivalent to that of the individual who highlights your receipts when you leave wal mart lol wal mart people are dumb gt the tsa shelters incompetent fools that should never be in a position of perceived power nothing good will ever come out of the tsa yes nothing good at all we should let people bring whatever they want onto planes with no checks at least then we wouldn t have to deal with ghetto tsa agents gt raise your hands how many people here are aware that you can

cia it was mostly harmless but a little disturbing to see this person suffering from a real mental illness and broadcasting it over youtube the deeper they explored their own delusions the more it became clear that this person had the potential to cause harm to others they believed that natural disasters like hurricane sandy and national tragedies like the sandy hook shooting were done by the cia specifically to punish them regardless of your opinion of who did sandy hook or if lanza had any accomplices i think we can all agree that they didn t so it to punish a kid named eric who suffers from schizophrenia and thinks that he is god here is where things went out of bounds in my opinion some trolls that plague us here and are constantly on the lookout for anything they can use to noticed this kid and latched onto him they started feeding his delusions and calling themselves they created a special subreddit for him where he is the central figure you can read about his delusions yourself in their sticky post the kid claims the navy yard shooter was being mind controlled in the same way that he himself is being mind controlled he talks about building a lead hut to escape from the voices the ring leader there is a user u <UNK> who has tried everything to get conspiracy to make him or u <UNK> a mod here or to get us to feature his story with a sticky when denied they have made threats and u <UNK> talks to <UNK> over skype and there is no telling what evil seeds he has planted in his mind there but its clear that king supports and reinforces this poor sick kid s delusions king has become this kids handler and he does everything and anything except steer this kid back towards reality if you look at the list of mods over there in their special subreddit you ll even find people there who are mods of prominent sub reddits like i believe that they intend to push this kid toward some kind of violent outburst irl and then blame it all on conspiracy because of this i have been keeping detailed logs of all the threats made to us in mod mail and the users inflating his ego in it all sounds like silly madness to us here but i remind you that the navy yard shooter tried to get help before his killing spree and people turned him away because they didn t see it as a serious matter http imgur com <UNK> http imgur com <UNK> these are just a few examples of

grandfather i was never read it by <UNK> or have seen it and it has presumably since been destroyed she wont tell me if the money was left to me legally in name of just all left to her to split up and given to me again she has strongly implied after tense polite questioning that the money was perhaps left to me in name and she has flat out said that the reasoning for locking all this money away from me i searched it its all there i just need to pay a very small fee for the order once i find out what is says i can maybe take the first step in getting it back and the next step will be finding out who s name is on the account i have access to the login information but have been to afraid to attempt once i have the will that will give me the boost to do it from that point i dont know really what steps to take if this is all true then i will obviously want to claim back the account legally in my name and the money stolen from me but what action should i take to make that happen going to the police is low on my list as i fear them not believing me the money i will have to pay perhaps to make and legal action happen towards <UNK> and any legal action taken out against me by <UNK> for revenge i could simply just login to the account and transfer the money to me after moving out or a much better option go to the bank with all necessary id and information have them transfer the money

she needs and wants", "body": "<UNK> <UNK> vs r lower echelon peon http what follows is a mere taste of the delicious feast of apparently what passes as biblical marriage according to some subscribers gt sir i congratulate you on posting such an excellent treatise on not only the true state of marriage but lovingly responding to a pastor who has caved in to the culture on the subject it s sad that even in the pulpit we have shepherds who will lead sheep astray due to a fear of becoming a social pariah i know a lot of the reason why he did this was because he was afraid of losing his congregation and by extension his paycheck but being a preacher of the word puts you in a unique position of submission to god where he will fill your pulpits as long as you preach faithfully as for me i pray daily that god would bring such a woman into my life being and still single is troublesome even lonely but i m trusting god to meet my needs in this area however that might present itself here is a brief selection from the op gt strong husbands and fathers such as charles ingalls or dr <UNK> have been replaced with incompetent irresponsible and undesirable fools such as al bundy and phil du the temptation to join the cultural crowd and demonize men husbands and fathers is strong and pastors are just as susceptible as anyone else p s apparently the op is not familiar with the current situation with bill cosby gt the truth is that wives innately desire to be lead by their husbands and will come to despise a husband who gives up his leadership to her when a husband properly engages as head of his family and leads with the whole family s well being in mind the wife finds it natural to submit to him her submission supplies the respect and admiration for which he hungers while his leadership supplies the security she craves even more so she naturally finds his new confident frame very attractive and soon the typical sex starved marriage is revived this triggers more emotional intimacy from the husband which delights his wife gt gt it wasn t until recently having failed to revive my marriage through multiple marriage books and counseling sessions that i learned these things by physical mental and spiritual self improvement efforts and a daily devotion to wisely lead my family my wife has rediscovered submission respect and admiration and an innate physical attraction to me i especially liked the rediscovered innate physical attraction gt the approach can work but is very inefficient and naturally causes the leader to be lazy it is very easy after working hours outside the home to simply say this happens for years and she grows accustomed to making all those decisions especially once the babies come one day you wake from your leadership slumber to find your wife scolding you for sitting on a piece of furniture the wrong way or for questioning her on what color curtains she buys you think gt gt how can the bible be outdated if you start to ignore certain parts of the bible because where does it end ultimately everything is subject to that critique and you become an a la carte christian picking only the convenient commands to follow is it the husband s decision when to have sex no you cannot force yourself on your wife when she does not want it if you truly respect and love her yes it is his decision however i do not believe he should ever force himself on his wife since as you said that would not be out of love or respect instead he should entice her with a confident display of male leadership if you had any shred of respect for your wife you also would not be writing this way saying wives are only to submit is saying that they cannot be trusted what about households where the wife runs the finances because her husband is bad at it should he still have reign over money no that is silly nothing i write suggests that wives cannot be trusted my wife is highly intelligent and capable i trust her more than anyone in the world she manages all our finances using the budget that we worked out and i ultimately endorsed yet she is fully aware that i can and would change the budget without her i if need be gt gt gt the wife can certainly do those things but that is not her primary role think of the husband like a captain and the wife as first mate when the captain is away its the first mate s job to take over captain responsibilities today s husbands are told by the culture to not be captain s but rather co captains this leads to indecision laziness and an internal anger within the man since he designed and innately wants to lead the symptoms are even worse when the husband embraces the concept that the wife quickly losses attraction to the adult child she now controls and sex drops to near zero this starts a vicious cycle of the husband doing everything he can to win the favor of his wife including the occasional plead for sex which only disgusts her and pushes her further away sound pretty trp it is which the op gives his rousing endorsement gt is devoted to understanding the true forces and dynamics involved in male and female relationships and using that knowledge to optimize your life it is not christian and there are many immature participants who simply want to game women however the bible is very as i once posted about i instead contribute to who are a more mature group of men who have incorporated knowledge into marriage to the great benefit of both them and their wife those men helped saved my marriage and i will forever be indebted a large number of them are christian and our posts and replies helps raise the level of discussion from the op s recent post history on gt haven t started banging her in front of them but then again wouldn t really mind having my boys hear their mom moaning for me from another room they re gonna learn it all sometime better within a happy home than on some internet site gt gt i m still in the phase been lifting and making nice gains projecting confidence and adding occasional soft flirting i have one girl flipping her hair and acting like a blithering idiot everytime i m around and two others who randomly brought me lunch last week one of those tried to sh t test me via text shot it down with ease next request i made of her she responded with with a sly smile my biggest challenge right now is to fight the urge to get each of them in bed i can barely bring myself to even make a cheeky comment to my wife hey man we all feel like that sometimes but that woman is your wife whom once cared or valued you enough to latch her foreseeable future onto you that doesn t mean you re bond to her outside of the marriage contract but it does me you have more than a fighting chance at winning this rp game with her and avoiding the financial and social raping of divorce game her focus all your energy on making her vagina tingle make sex so good she has no choice but to beg for more the next day and if she doesn t respond then dread her hardcore stay out late with some buddies don t call stay at a hotel spray your shirt with some perfume flirt with a girl at a bar enough to get her number and make sure she sees it etc when the fight comes let her know it s her you prefer but that you re tired of scraps from the table and you re gonna get your due one way or another ten bucks says she ll come around these were just the first posts i ran across in his history and that was a deep enough trip into chauvinism for me some of the posters really got out their pom poms gt please stop adding to the word of god your own personal cultural subtext it s false teachings like yours limiting the submission of a wife which is very much complete and biblical that have ruined the vast majority of modern women and have made finding a good christian biblically submissive wife incredibly difficult now realize one thing if the husband does something that is against god then the wife is not to submit to that desire the bible states this clearly because the wife is first submitting to god and then to her husband look at the story of abigail if you really want to see a good submissive biblical wife who follows god first and her husband second but submits to both fully based on biblical precepts i wish i could find an abigail in this day and age but living in so cal makes it nearly impossible even in a church gt gt in the story of abigail and <UNK> <UNK> is a cruel abusive and foolish tyrant of a husband no kind of leader to his wife at all from a biblical standpoint yet abigail having been taught the scriptures and trusting in the word of god fulfilled her rightful place as a submissive wife in the home and was fully submissive to her husband until he did something that was against the will of god then and only then did she disobey his order and even after doing so she still submitted to him humbly informing him of her disobedience and showing prudence of mind waiting to inform him of her disobedience until after he had sobered up now perhaps in the past some man influenced a woman in how she could be rebellious in a way that would destabilize society but the fact that women are rebellious against their husbands by nature is nothing the bible doesn t account for just look at jezebel and her end if you doubt that gt gt gt many men especially those who aren t bible believing christians just don t see the point of trying to lead a stubborn combative degenerate controlling and disparaging woman who fights them at every turn and refuses to appreciate the sacrifices he makes for them he has a real thing for abigail but at least this poster recognizes that women are humans quite a revolutionary concept gt you re right women are human beings but men are as well and we re all trying to follow god s word the best we can sadly this generation has a surplus of rebellious women who refuse to follow god s design for marriage based on their minds being poisoned by feminism social justice i hate to tell you this but if you re waiting for the backwards mentality of the word of god to die out you re going to have to get in line behind voltaire diocletian h l hastings etc this shit being <UNK> with

"body": "<UNK> relationships am et throwaway general background i have chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia it s a debilitating illness with tiredness and significant pain i also have a lot of anxiety but it s not purely a mental health issue as i have physical symptoms i ve had it for years and haven t been able to work i am living at home with my parents with my research i think i can improve from my condition and i am committed to making progress i work really hard at this i want to make this point to make it clear that i m fighting the urge to sulk in a corner my parents are good and supportive parents i have other siblings who live at home with me two of them have bipolar and while we love them and they love us they are difficult kids because of their mental illness naturally my mother is taxed my mother helps me by cooking meals for me and occasionally helping with laundry and other tasks like that she does also make time for me when she can she has gone along with my father in getting an extra car for me to use and other such things more specific problem i get anxious and stressed when my mother talks to me about my illness she talks a lot more than she listens and offers advice that while basically okay is not really specific or helpful when she gives me her time because of her habits i get stressed because i don t feel understood and instead feel somewhat managed when i feel uncomfortable like this i get overwhelmed and have no clue what to do my mother notices my stress but thinks i m angry at her instead of stressed even though i understand she is well intentioned and does care for me the problem is when i try to communicate that she isn t talking with me in a way that is helpful to me she gets even angrier and i get angry too my angry reinforces her belief that i am unreasonable i tell her she needs to change the way she does things but she says she doesn t need to change and or she can t change she says its her personality and i just got to accept it she thinks if i don t respond in an unstressed way then i am not respecting her i wish i could accept it but i m hurting so much that i need someone to listen to me empathetically and not just give me advice without understanding i am lonely a lot and desperate for help almost daily because of my illness the thing is i know it s not a personality thing at least not completely my dad listens to me so much better than my mother and while i know he has a different personality i know that empathetic listening is a skill you can learn i ve even learned a lot about compassion from being sick myself and know that i say my mother needs to listen better she says i need to communicate better i know i have responsibility for my actions i feel terrible a lot and know i can give sour responses when i am in pain i take responsibility for that i also do have responsibility for learning to communicate better i think there is responsibilities we both have but she doesn t think she needs to do anything different the latest episode is when i tried to communicate by giving her the chapter in habits of highly effective people about empathetic listening she got really mad i tried to tell her to think of this as problem solving i tried to tell her that i do accept responsibility for trying to communicate better she wouldn t work with this i think she gets mad because she thinks that if i say she is doing one thing wrong it means she is an unsupportive mother she isn t unsupportive but she is causing me a lot of pain i feel like what s described in this reddit thread is part of what is going on this makes me terribly stressed and when i get stressed my illness gets worse i had three days where i couldn t get out of bed because of this during those days because i feel so hurt i can t help but feel angry at my mother again and again it s the worst i ve ever felt in my life i ve had maybe of these episodes over the years i ve been home i might be able to accept that my mother won t change but i am at a loss at how to do so how do i do this things i ve done i see a therapist every weeks i ve had my mom come with me to my therapist i ve talked with my pastor at my church he s suggested the possibility of moving out of the house for a while my therapist disagrees my dad thinks we should avoid ever getting into our arguments somehow he listens to both of us but doesn t want to take someone s side i ve tried using the cognitive behavior therapy techniques i ve been learning and practicing to help me with my emotions the problem is i get too overwhelmed i m trying not to be bitter or resentful tl dr mother doesn t understand my anxiety and gets hurt when i say she doesn t because i have a physical illness as well i can t cope with

him some slack because i think the women who took in my information gave misleading notes and he is the first person i have met who understands how hard stay at home moms have it which is refreshing to me at the second visit he asked how what had been the most upsetting thoughts i d had since our last talk i mention sil and all her the conversation leads wendy i talk about getting u faux the <UNK> to understand how bad wendy was and how to help him build a spine i ve been using the analogy that keeping him aware of the abuse has been as challenging as keeping an alcoholic sober while in a bar the grip wendy s spell had on him was impossible to break i m finally on the home stretch i talked about how people excused her and how she hid behind fil and his mental illness i told many stories about of she upset me he laughed at the one where she he said that she was definitely sending me a very clear message right from the beginning therapist asked how wendy and fil responded to nc i said they were still sending cards to the kids he then asked how much did i think they blamed me i said they must because until i came around faux was there dumping ground he told me i must feel very isolated even though i saw through their veil helped and stood by faux during his decisions and had worked hard to try to make things better i was very alone people would either blame me for what happened or they would agree with me and feel bad for faux and ignore what i have done no matter what no one would really understand and feel the burden i had and that it was clear wendy and fil would just be waiting for the day faux came back to them never giving up on trying to get him back so this problem could go on forever this is the first time anyone in my real life just sided with me he didn t make excuses he didn t say how bad he felt for faux he didn t defend strangers who excused her i got support for how much i have been through i do not want to take away from the abundant amount of support i have gotten from here and all the advice which has been great i even told him how much i loved this place and how much happier i am you all have actually made it easier to move on and forgive faux but to get it in person in one conversation was beyond comforting and relieving i didn t feel myself getting defensive by excuses questions and assumptions because he had none he just believed me right off the bat i feel like some of the burden has been lifted i didn t have to fight and prove my point just to have someone feel bad for everyone but me not that i m looking for

hell i ve never in my two three some years of lurking and actively participating on this site have ever seen such a blatant pro piracy jerk this guy seriously thinks that just because content creators want to surprise surprise get paid for his work that they re allowed to pirate it if they can t have it cheaply conveniently and in high quality look i pirate shit all the time i have nothing against people who pirate and i do think copy right infringement laws are a bit extreme but the truth is of people pirate entertainment because it s free they don t want to pay for it so they justify their acts as some noble way to stand up to the oppressive content creators how do you think the people over at will handle this surprisingly the top comment is calling the op out but the comment chain following it gets into the debate if piracy is a way of protest or a way of getting free things gt if you won t sell me your product the way i want you to i m entitled to steal it gt gt if you make your digital content really hard to acquire legally you re damn fucking right i m torrenting it would game of thrones be the most torrented show every year it s aired if hbo got its collective brains together and decided that maybe just maybe netflix isn t a fad and it would be a really great way to make money ahh here we go this is the reddit i know here s the guy saying this guy is saying that hbo just needs to offer got to a rd party company to stream because that s exactly how they ll make money to continue he franchise gt but game of thrones isn t hard to acquire legally it s just expensive does having a high cost count as being hard to acquire gt gt i m either buying a t v and some expensive bullshit cable package from companies i hate with all sorts of shit i don t want need just so i can watch one show on one channel or i m waiting forever for the boxed set to come out paying far far more per episode than anything on any of the streaming services that exist at a store i don t particularly like either or you know i could just torrent the episodes as they come out if they had a reasonable means of acquiring their show they d have my money i m hardly unique in that regard and by the way i mean reasonable today not reasonable five years ago markets change hbo is slow too bad so sad their shows are going to get heavily pirated isn t hard to acquire legally it s just expensive also when you re talking about consumerism expensive hard to acquire yep you heard it here folks you have every right to take something that you can t afford this is why these redditors also support poor people stealing their cars and money because and if something is hard to obtain you can just take it gt except how is it stealing is it stealing if i borrow a copy from my friend people used to share movies a lot and i never see it brought up if someone isn t going to pay to see something they ll find another way to see it and if they had no intention of paying the movie studio lost nothing no product was lost can these people seriously not understand why content creators want to be paid for their work they seriously can t be that deluded people who work hard want people who enjoy their stuff to give them money that s the foundation of commercial entertainment these people just spew some crap about how they re protesting to protect consumer rights when in reality they just want free stuff but get mad when told that it s illegal gt that s the movie equivalent of me going to your house and saying times and if you say no all times i can legally steal it i don t exactly agree that his analogy is perfect but this guy has the basic sediment but of course he s downvoted and then the crown jewel of the pro piracy jerk is he is able to not only be pro piracy he also incorporates a horrible analogy police state nonsense and stuff about how people are being forced to pirate because the other methods are too much of an inconvenience edit just got this wonderful response for one of my comments in that thread gt it s cheaper to illegally download shit that i can find on netflix but uh oh i subscribe to netflix and lovefilm and hulu and i don t torrent shit i can find on there it s cheaper to illegally download shit that i can find at the local dvd store used or on sale but what s this i buy shit from there too it s cheaper to illegally download pdfs of books i want to read than order them on amazon or pick them up used but guess what i buy books on amazon go to the store it s cheaper to download rulebooks for boardgames i want to play and then play them for free on vassal or <UNK> but board game companies generally attempt to make things as available as they can at reasonable prices so i don t i am far from unique in that regard most people would rather pay for things legally because we re responsible <UNK> by the way i never used the term so shove it up your ass if i go to a store to buy something and the owner is an asshole charging way above what similar items cost elsewhere and forcing me to jump through hoops to get it i get to go to another store he hasn t forced me to go elsewhere i still could have bought it there but he s an asshole so i didn t in the case of cable companies there s no other store so there s no other legal way of keeping them honest there s no people to torrent there s no to torrent but we can torrent and i m glad we have that ability because it s really the only way we re going to keep these companies honest this dude is super hostile when defending his precious pirating"},

personally i just realised that i was better off distancing myself from the vitriol that is always present when discussing movies on and the internet in general i was just recommending the film but judging from some of the comments i received it was as if i was insulting people and wasting their time i received a pm from someone just ranting at me about how horrible the film was as if to say my opinion was wrong when i clicked on that user s history they were just going around posting the same message on every discussion in regards to the movie it was as if they were on a mission to ensure other people couldn t enjoy the film it completely opened my eyes to what s happening people take pleasure out of hating movies on people take pleasure out of hating movies on the internet in general actually yeah batman v superman isn t the greatest thing ever made and i totally get why people think it s a terrible film but it s still not worth all the vitriol and hate that gets spewed around whenever someone says they like it it is just a movie i recently hopped back on reddit after taking a break and went back to the hate just upset me it sucks that we devote threads to hating on movies and that people take the time to write long hateful rants about films and then downvote people who dare to defend it i remember when i was an angsty film student and i had to be above the films i saw to convey my knowledge i had to point out the flaws of a film to show off my film i remember during work shopping sessions in class feedback on other people s pieces weren t valid unless we could think of a negative i remember watching a piece that was perfect in my eyes and i said so to the person who made it but the teacher insisted that it couldn t be perfect and that i needed to think of flaws otherwise my reading of the film was worthless that s the issue the easiest way to seem as if you know things is to be pessimistic and cynical i was once this way towards films but it was tiring looking at everything through a negative lens is just a lazy way to come across as intelligent writing a lengthy post about how you enjoyed a film that others don t can reap downvotes but simply saying will probably get you upvotes i guess my point is that it s perfectly fine to like things people on the internet would lead you to believe that liking things makes you stupid but that s not right they make it seem as if the only way to critique films is by being snarky arrogant hateful hyperbolic they try to take down people who see things differently none of that is right it s just sad my little cousins watch batman v superman on repeat because they love it they have the lego sets some toys and they are obsessed batman v superman makes them happy but if they went online and expressed that with good intentions they d be laughed at because they have a different taste to most i find that so so sad people online enjoy robbing other people of enjoyment both fans and detractors alike can be overly entitled to these films in particular it seems and the conversations tend to devolve into hate so if this post resonates with at least one person and makes them rethink the way they discuss films with other people then i feel like this post was worth it be kind to people who disagree with you don t be a hostile dick men are still good thanks for reading"}, {"title":

by funding programs that discourage inhaling mind altering combustible plant matter at a young age how utterly draconian anyone other than pro marijuana lobbyists deserve nothing those who believe children should be gently discouraged from smoking pot are merely being placated notice too the flood of rhetorical questions that if op took the time to research the answers themselves might actually not help his argument at all i mean i don t know but maybe some of it if none of it was would that even matter if all of it was would that somehow change anything furthermore op doesn t just reject

that then that is bullshit colorado the minions of take this sentiment and run with it gt gt it stood out as shady to me as well literal millions being spent on advertising against the drug that provided said money in the first place a bit hypocritical if you ask me hypocritical shady apparently we re just throwing out all the tenets of legality advocacy out the door it s all or nothing either the government legalizes endorses promotes and basically gives away free weed to everyone or it s if the government is being hypocritical this is not the place it s happening gt gt gt it seems that some backdoor promises were made to appease those who opposed the legislation in the first place in all though who knows where that money is really going the thugs in suits should never be totally left with that much money i think the only real thing working in the public interest is that it s still illegal federally so if there is anything shady going on at least the federal government can start sniffing around backdoor promises thugs with suits etc lol what the government is much more money than million we can t trust the government with more because of thugs in suits because uh it

knowingly don t understand another user in that thread tentatively supports the idea and is met with inanity like gt what if they too every dime and put it towards education though that would actually

but whatever as a preliminary blanket statement so i m not tripping over myself this enti trying to be polite i am not intentionally trying to offend anyone diminish the horribleness of sexual crimes make you feel like you got what you deserved you are all wonderful people especially rape victims as someone who has never been raped has had no friends disclose that they have been raped i want to know about your opinions personal experience on why rape is so terrible for a person to experience deal with for the rest of their lives and i wonder if the experience is different depending on the circumstances e g were there drugs alcohol involved could you remember it etc this question comes up in response to a recent incident that happened involving students from a us school james madison university in which a girl from jmu was sexually assaulted by male students from jmu in florida while on spring break i don t necessarily want to discuss the issues of how they re handling it or jurisdiction or too many of the specifics however when it came up almost everyone had this instant knee jerk reaction and are saying that the men should ve gotten worse punishment half of the news articles you can google say it was rape but there s no support for it at all and she hasn t pressed charges describing a bit more in detail for those who are curious i am curious about why rape is an crime at least that s how it seems to me since it seems far more sensationalized than murder or any number of physical crimes and also why because of that people become bloodthirsty even when the truth of certain rape assault situations is not so clear"}, {"title": "this whole fucking thread right here fuck", "body": "<UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as soon as i saw the title of this til thread i was

the number of women sexually assaulted per year at in and campus tribunals will ban men from school for even being accused of rape yet you sit here and completely pull out your ass that rape victims are hated by society also it is so incredibly disingenuous to say of rapes go unreported because that factors in male on male and female on male rape and as we all know more men are raped annually

movement who truly think is a pertinent issue but if that s the case they should have the common sense to seperate themselves from a movement which identifies with the most vile people imaginable that being said posts in supporting <UNK> have been incredibly popular and the comment sections have been uniformly nasty most of them campaign against social justice which is something i cannot really comprehend since when did being conscious and accomodating to anyone other than the white male become a bad thing their disdain for social justice warriors is directly linked to their hate for feminism they cry that feminism isn t about equal rights but about more rights for women it s the fearful mindset common among <UNK> who are intimidated by the growing inclusion of women in society

on ferguson related posts are mind bogglingly racist with most comments claiming brown was a no good thug who deserved to get shot over ten times with his hands up from half a football field away because he stole some swisher sweets stealing doesn t have the death penalty for a reason a common sentiment appears to be that the photos of michael brown graduating that the media are using aren t representative of the real michael brown and they should use pictures of him looking much more like a thug instead if your death became a national news story odds are they re going to use a picture where you look presentable and nice just because you really liked harry potter doesn t mean the media is obliged to use a photo of you dressed as ron for halloween a few years ago the same goes for michael the fact he came from an <UNK> background and wasn t always an angel doesn t mean intimidating photos of him need to be used much more of the comments relate to how only black people do these

caravan raids his preemptive attack on the banu <UNK> the ridda wars after his death and the final commands he gave on his deathbed etc well gt the very start of islamic war began when <UNK> citizens decided to steal the property of muslim emmigrants from there muhammad defended what he and his people rightfully owned and took the city to protect his people and their property that s a very interesting spin so muhammad the trouble maker is exiled after years of subversive activity somehow he s still the owner of his former property though why i have no idea exiles usually don t have those rights and especially not in th century arabia so he by raiding random caravans coming out of mecca for booty and enslaving then selling people for money riiight sounds totally like he s only interested in the innocent activity of getting his old toys back at least the apologia make some sense but to claim he s totally innocent and only interested in his old property and finally muhammad apparently takes mecca to hmm muhammad s people were with him and they were exiled as well last i recall did they not have a good base in medina does this not sound suspiciously similar to the usa invading iraq for their own interests then claiming it s for protection were the majority of people in mecca not against muhammad so he was defending his little group by conquering a hostile city putting some poets to the sword and then smashing the religious history of mecca alright then gt before passing judgement one must also realize that this was in c bce when arguably the most peaceful force on the planet was the roman empire and that was achieved at the tip of a sword here we have the standard cultural relativism defense which ignores muhammad s status in islam and the entire point of criticisms to begin with i also have no idea what he means by rome in that period being peaceful they were locked in a centuries long struggle with the <UNK> that played out in mesopotamia one of the reasons why people in that area welcomed the muslim rulers who imposed a jizya that was lower than the taxes they payed before but that s more bad history than anything i have to say this post

across this thread in <UNK> the other day and almost posted it as its own discussion item but in the context of what my friend said it is more relevant many of the comments say they observed that it

"<UNK> <UNK> ulf r <UNK> why pipes burst surprisingly ice forming in a pipe does not typically cause a break where the ice blockage occurs it s not the radial expansion of ice against the wall of the pipe that causes the break rather following a complete ice blockage in a pipe continued freezing and expansion inside the pipe causes water pressure to increase downstream between the ice blockage and a closed faucet at the end it s this increase in water pressure that leads to pipe failure usually the pipe bursts where little or no ice has formed letting the water run letting a faucet drip during extreme cold weather can prevent a pipe from bursting it s not that a small flow of water prevents freezing this helps but water can freeze even with a slow flow rather opening a faucet will provide relief from the excessive pressure that builds between the faucet and the ice blockage when freezing occurs if there is no excessive water pressure there is no burst pipe even if the water inside the

is now in a coma according to the article the police were not aware that there was a child in the house as there was nothing to indicate that they have stated that yes something catastrophic went wrong and they ll be taking measures to ensure that something like this doesn t happen again so let s take a look at the comments first comment isn t too bad just someone angry at the cops that they re not doing anything to help pay for the medical bills or assist the family the twice gilded reply to it though is one of the best jerks i ve ever seen camps gt it s the for profit prisons and the

comment isn t bad just an opinion on no knock warrants a rather sound one too but i don t know enough about the issue to comment gilded here is gt cops do more damage to society than drug users right because the deaths and violence in the drug trade is more damaging than people who uphold the law and deal with criminals more highlights from the comments gt profit at the expense of freedom and

losing his son to cancer time to circlejerk about religion and indie games", "body": "<UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i really dislike the people on this web site sometimes so to understand what s going on here you need a bit of backstory recently the radio show podcast radiolab published an episode called the cathedral which detailed a young husband and wife losing their third son joel to cancer the boy was essentially sick his entire life with tumor after tumor one night when he was very young his father ryan was holding him in the hospital during chemotherapy trying to get him to stop crying eventually out of desperation he prayed to god to help his son did i mention they are christians anyway his son stopped crying ryan being a programmer had an idea to create a video game scene about his experience in the hospital room with his son a game in which every choice the player makes is the wrong one and nothing works a puzzle that can t be solved kind of like caring for a child dying of cancer right that game which has been released and is called that dragon cancer morphed into a way for ryan and amy to deal with the grief and helplessness they felt losing their son to cancer in perhaps the penultimate moment their son was diagnosed with another tumor this time however it was in an area that had already received radiation treatment the doctor informed them that there was no way to radiate this area a second time because it risks brain death in effect this tumor was untreatable their son was going to die being people of faith they did the only thing they could they had their congregation over at their house and prayed together for god to intervene on behalf of their son their son died later that night touching isn t it well not for the sociopaths at reddit com on the top comment gt i m not sure if i lack empathy or come from too much of an atheist point of view but this episode was terrible the whole praying away the cancer thing really bothers me makes me wonder how people can blindly follow religion the whole video game thing with no winning was ridiculous i can t believe these people spent all off their money trying to make this game they didn t or joel received radiation treatment and chemotherapy his entire life they were desperate and helpless i m an atheist too but i understand that people of faith rely on that faith in times of great adversity i couldn t imagine the feeling of knowing your child s death is imminent and what the hell happened to this is an artist using his medium to express the inexpressible but since it s not an fps it s not a real video game gt i agree listening to them praying and wailing all night while their child died was heartbreaking i grew up in a fundamentalist religion and am now an atheist gt its sad to me that people can t just embrace life all the joy along with the pain why can t they just write off their dying son and not worry about it what s the big deal someone points out that it was after the doctor said there was nothing they could do that they turned to their faith the reply gt alright cool man you have your opinion that this is interesting my opinion is that religion is just an absolute waste of time i get that they aren t doing any harm but a rational person to me would be using their time more effectively to try and solve the problem not just praying that it solves itself to me its giving up on life when its the time you need to dig deep and get some shit done for me its sad and bothersome that these people are stuck in this mindset my only curiosity about religious people is how they are full grown adults and fall into this mind trap of traditional thinking really and what would you have done about inoperable untreatable brain cancer i m just curious what would the logical thing have been to do to gt wow this was absolutely shitty a show of highlights from a different show about a video game i would never play more well i would play it i thought it sounded intriguing i d like to see how someone could convey an experience like this through a medium i greatly enjoy but again this idea that unless it s a triple a fps it s worthless and not worth playing gt maybe i m just cynical but this whole thing seemed like an exercise in misery reveling where i can see the therapeutic benefit in making the game i can t understand why anyone on the outside would want to engage themselves in it gt the most heartbreaking and really infuriating thing to me is that the parents seemed so u to face the reality of their son s impeding death gt that s probably coming from a personal place as my mother was a woman of faith and died a very slow and miserable death from cancer all the while promising me a young boy that god would heal her this is just obnoxious to me this idea that they screwed up by not how would you prepare for something like that what process would make that not destroy you emotionally there s more of this the general sentiment is that this was one of the worst radiolab episodes ever the parents were wrong to believe in god and ask him to heal their child that this video game is a pointless waste of time that should never have been made i liked this episode but i can see how if you have no empathy this episode would be boring if you can t put yourself in the place of his parents what s the point"}, {"title": "thanks

but only when it suits them gt e g consider humans with predator level technology against a civilisation with dark ages technology it d be a slaughter in fact in the new world the spanish had a much smaller technological advantage of the aztecs and yet it was still a slaughter gt i e as usual societies that pride themselves on being warrior races aren t actually that effective as warriors you re better off concentrating on technological advance and adopting a ruthlessly pragmatic approach to dealing with other cultures gt incidentally there s one example of a human civilisation at a slight technological disadvantage totally defeating one that prided itself on being a warrior race the us and uk versus nazi germany in wwii the allies used relatively low technology with great ruthlessness lancaster and b bombers against population targets they also mass manufactured sherman tanks individually a sherman was no match for a german panzer still the difference in production rates meant the germans were slowly zerg rushed by the greater numbers of mass manufactured allied crap gt the nazis didn t regard the war in the east as a place for chivalry they saw it as a war of annihilation against subhumans but it seems they did sort of regard the war in the west as being a fight against equals with whom they hoped to conclude a negotiated peace and they seemed to be genuinely horrified when churchill and harris carpet bombed them with great enthusiasm to force unconditional surrender despite that gt now the difference is that the uk didn t regard the war against germany as being in any way glorious or chivalric but rather about industrialized slaughter aimed at trashing german industry which worked very well indeed gt i e subpar technology and a cynical view of war works advanced technology and an overly romanticised view of honourable heroic warriors doesn t why it s bad history describes lancaster and b bombers as state of the art technology that served way into post war times claims a sherman was no match for a german panzer panzer just means i m sure a sherman could have taken on a panzer ii claims allied success in ww was due to whereas allied technology

that they played games against their second and third rounds were against teams that to that point had won a combined conference semifinals and conference finals had a team in nashville that had only one forward who scored points and a team in san jose whose goalie s save percentage was below their first round opponent had a rookie goalie they were outscored by in the conference quarterfinals teams that get outscored like that normally don t advance from that round uhmmm what gt they played in a horrible division with bad teams that they played games against yeah we still won the western conference by a whooping points that s wins or of those easy games gt second and third rounds were against teams that to that point had won a combined conference semifinals and conference finals because apparently history matters gt their first round opponent had a rookie goalie wait our first round opponent the defending champions the chicago blackhawks i thought history mattered also just because he was a rookie didn t mean that corey crawford was bad of goalies that played in gt games he was th out of in save but he was a rookie so obviously any good team should have steamrolled him gt had a team in nashville that had only one forward who scored points and arguably the second best goalie in the league that season like fair nashville wasn t the best team we could have faced but i thought defense wins championships or is it defense proves arguments unless it doesn t in which case offence wins championships gt and a team in san jose whose goalie s save percentage was below was san jose the second best team in the west that year yes oh but they re goalie had a bad playoffs so the canucks suck also the sjs had players with or more points in the regular season in which case i bring back defense proves arguments unless it doesn t in which case offence wins championships unless it doesn t in which case defense proves arguments also apparently chicago was shit because they
