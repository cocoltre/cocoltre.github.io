      <td>&lt;UNK&gt; australia u zd fleece white as snow i know that sometimes criminal actions can make your blood boil and you feel the need to vent however this should not be posted to any public forum as it has the potential to unfairly influence a jury post from contains a number of comments which are of particular concern including one post which was a link to the defendant s facebook page the potential to impact on what may be considered a fair trial may be summarised as quoting from gt if material is obtained or used by the jury privately whether before or after retirement two linked principles bedrocks of the administration of criminal justice and indeed the rule of law are contravened the first is open justice that the defendant in particular but the public too is entitled to know of the evidential material considered by the decision making body so indeed should everyone with a responsibility for the outcome of the trial including counsel and the judge and in an appropriate case the court of appeal criminal division this leads to the second principle the entitlement of both the prosecution and the defence to a fair opportunity to address all the material considered by the jury when reaching its verdict such an opportunity is essential to our concept of a fair trial all members of the reddit community may feel themselves more or less anonymous and so may choose to publish as they please in spite of the risk of contempt of court however i believe that the principle of a fair trial is an important one to uphold and one we should respect now strictly speaking members of juries should be under strict instructions not to access social media or other online material relating to the case however studies have shown that this instruction is often disobeyed by jurors it is not difficult to imagine a scenario where jurors might stumble upon the forum above and then out of their own curiosity read further and form conclusions based on some of the opinions they have read prejudicial online comments can potentially result in the dismissal of juries a retrial appeal against a conviction and prosecution for contempt of court against the publisher so in conclusion not a good idea to make speculative or prejudicial comments about a matter before the courts in australia thanks for hearing me out</td>
