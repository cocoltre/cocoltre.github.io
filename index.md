## Introduction {#top}

Today, Wikipedia is part of everybody’s life. It is the first source that most people will check when they want to get information. This website is maintained by volunteers through open collaboration, and what makes its strength, can also bring problems. Wikipedia aims to have a neutral point of view and stay strictly factual but can we guarantee this when anyone can become a contributor? A study [<sup>[1]</sup>](#ref) observed that a large number of Wikipedia editors change their behavior and focus on editing controversial topics when promoted to administrators, they might be biased (consciously or not) and influence these articles. This concern about bias in Wikipedia content leads us to consider how such biases might extend to user interactions with the platform, in the Wikispeedia game.

Wikispeedia is a game where players are tasked with navigating from one Wikipedia article to another using only internal Wikipedia links. The objective of this game is entertainment, but also allowed to gather data on how humans perceive the semantic distance between different concepts. The paths that players take from the start article to the end article, along with the number of clicks and the time taken, offer valuable insights into the way people relate and categorize information[<sup>[3]</sup>](#ref). We will use this insight to understand the effect of potential political bias. Our study aims to examine the political bias within Wikipedia and its potential impact on Wikispeedia players.

Our dataset is an extensive collection derived from the Wikispeedia game, featuring detailed records on how players moved from one Wikipedia article to another, a process we'll refer to as 'the path' in our subsequent analysis. This dataset encompasses 4,604 Wikipedia articles as they existed in 2007, meticulously documenting user navigation and thereby shedding light on patterns in the pursuit of information. It also captures the duration users spend on these paths, providing a window into their engagement levels and the complexity of the topics encountered. Furthermore, the dataset includes categorizations for each article, facilitating

Firstly, let’s define political bias : this refers to a tendency to orient or modify information to make a political position more attractive. To define that, plain text of the articles was assessed in relation to two other well-known sites that reproduce Wikipedia in a politically biased way: [Rationalwiki](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Main_Page) and [Infogalactic](https://infogalactic.com/info/Main_Page). According to [Media Bias/Fact check](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/), these websites are 

Our exploration into the realm of political biases in Wikipedia and their potential influence on Wikispeedia players has led us to some intriguing observations. There seems to be a pattern where players' choices within the game are influenced by the political tone of the articles. The political bias in a player's path impacts some of the games statistics such as success rate for example. On the other hand, we cannot say that players tend to choose a certain bias more than expected, as the distribution of their choices correspond to the links available to them. It makes sense, as they cannot know the content of the article, or the political bias within before clicking on the link.

Our exploration into the realm of political biases in Wikipedia and their potential influence on Wikispeedia players has led us to some intriguing observations. There seems to be a pattern where players' choices within the game are influenced by the political tone of the articles. The political bias in a player's path impacts some of the games statistics such as success rate for example.

It makes sense, as they cannot know the content of the article, or the political bias within before clicking on the link.

However, it's crucial to remember that these are initial observations and not absolute conclusions. Our determinations of the political affiliations of articles are based on a model we created, which, while useful and pretty accurate, is based using texts taken from websites with known politcal stances. This process assumes that articles resembling the content of these websites share the same bias, which may not capture bias accurately. Detecting or characterizing bias in a text is a difficult task, even for humans.

Acknowledging the exploratory nature of our study, it's evident that further research is necessary. A broader dataset would be invaluable in deepening our understanding of the nuances in player behavior and the motivations behind their choices. Future investigations could aim to more accurately determine how these observed biases in navigation might reflect larger patterns in how people interact with information online, particularly in politically sensitive contexts.
